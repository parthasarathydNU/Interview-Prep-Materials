This is a [[simulation problem]] where we https://Leetcode.com/problems/time-taken-to-cross-the-door/  (2534).

#hard #queue #multi-queue 


Solvable within #30-minutes

In this problem we have a door and people entering and exiting the door at given instant of time. There are certain rules regarding who can enter and who can exit the door. 

#### Notes

Simulation problems are best solved by using data structures that most closely resemble the problem at hand. In this case, since people enter and exit the door from two sides of the door, it simplifies the solution if we use two queues, one to enter and one to exit. 

This did not fall anywhere on the flowchart.
