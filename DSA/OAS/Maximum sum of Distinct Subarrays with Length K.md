This is a [[sliding window problem]]  https://Leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-subarrays-with-length-k

#medium #15-minutes #sliding-window #prefix-sum #duplicates

### Note

At first glance this problem looks like a problem that can be solved using prefix sums, but this is a much simpler problem than that. 

The way we arrange the solution is key to the problem. 

#mistake
### Mistakes I did
- This problem looked very likely that it included prefix sum, but it did not
- I did not write the pseudo code for the code flow
- I did not visualize the problem in sufficient detail
- Rather than going from the problem to the solution, and visualizing it I jumped to coding it / coming to conclusions about the implementation
- I did not arrange the code before writing it, this caused issues with edge cases and improper calculation
- #revisit
