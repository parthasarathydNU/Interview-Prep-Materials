Based on the technologies you've listed, I'll categorize them into four areas: Front-end, Back-end, DevOps, and AI. Below is a table with these categories, listing each technology and columns for you to fill regarding your proficiency for each (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). I've also added a column for marking technologies you'd like to focus on for your next interview.
