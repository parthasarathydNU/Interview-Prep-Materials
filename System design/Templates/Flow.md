Practice with timer

You are having a system design meet where you are called on to provide expertise and help them understand how to design the system
- give them data points so they will want to work with you
- Build the system with them
- You drive the discussion and they assist by answering questions 

--——————————- Start ———————————

 - 5 minutes Understanding the system by asking questions 
 - 5 minutes - understanding performance and storage requirements- back of hand calcs
 - 10 minutes
	 - functional requirements and API
	 - Rough model of the data
 - 5 minutes
	 - Non functional requirements listing  
	 - CAP theorem discussion 

--———————-25 minute mark—————————

Remaining 30 minutes

5 minutes 
- Start by building blocks that would solve the functional requirements 
- Refine the data model along the way
- iteratively visit system functional requirements 
- functional until we have the building blocks ready

Ask for consensus- do a rough check if we meet functional requirements 

--———————- 30 minute mark —————————

- Have functional design ready 

Begin designing for non functional requirements 

15 minutes
- Iteratively improving the system to move towards the non functional requirements 
- Driven by cap theom
- Design for various ility requirements 
- Discussing trade offs 
- demonstrating depth of knowledge 
- Interact with interviewer

Ask for consensus- do a rough check if we meet non functional requirements 

--———————— 45 minute mark —————————

5 minutes 
- What else
- Talk about security 
- Monitoring 
- Observability
- Cost
- Ease of integration with other systems
- Testing

5 minutes
- Summarize what we have seen so far and map the current system to the defined non functional requirements 
- talk about future of this system and current limitations 

--———————— 55 minute mark —————————-

Ask for consensus- do a rough check if we meet non functional requirements 

Prepare questions for interviewer
