This compressed version maintains the key elements of the system design process while fitting within a 40-minute timeframe. The introduction sets the stage for the discussion, establishing the interviewee's expertise and approach to the design process.

---------------------------------

Behavioral interview is not that intense so amazon level prep is fine

Class Design and API design 

Ask about the level of the role to the recruiter

Ask the recruiter if they specifically want  a senior role or will it be calibrated based on interview performance

Class Design and API Design is very common, 

inputs outputs.. 

Could be both REST APIs or internal class diagrams and code so study for both

Learnability is the primary aspects that Microsoft Looks for

Show learnability in terms of asking questions about the systems the team is handling and what challenges that they are facing, and different aspects they have considered so that way we show learnability
