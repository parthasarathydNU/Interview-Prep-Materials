# Distributed Queue System Design

## Project Overview

This project documents the design and architecture of a distributed queue system. It follows the evolution of the system design from initial requirements gathering to the final architecture, covering various aspects of distributed systems, scalability, and performance.

## Contents

1. **Problem Statement**: Introduces the concept of communication between producer and consumer services, comparing synchronous and asynchronous communication methods.

2. **Problem Evolution**: A series of documents detailing the step-by-step design process:
   - Requirements gathering
   - High-level architecture
   - VIP (Virtual IP) and load balancing
   - Frontend web service
   - Metadata service
   - Backend service
   - Detailed backend service architecture
   - Additional concepts (queue operations, message handling, security, monitoring)
   - Summary and evaluation of the final design

3. **Images**: Diagrams and visual representations of various aspects of the system architecture.

## Key Features of the Designed System

- Scalable architecture with no single point of failure
- High availability through redundancy across multiple data centers
- Asynchronous communication using distributed queues
- Configurable message delivery semantics
- Security measures including encryption in transit and at rest
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities

## Non-Functional Requirements

The final architecture aims to meet the following non-functional requirements:

- Scalability
- High Availability
- Performance
- Durability

## Usage

This project serves as a comprehensive guide for designing a distributed queue system. It can be used as:

1. A learning resource for understanding distributed systems concepts
2. A reference for system designers and architects
3. A case study for evaluating and comparing different architectural decisions in distributed systems

## Contributing

While this is primarily a documentation project, contributions in the form of additional insights, corrections, or improvements to the design are welcome. Please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss potential changes.
