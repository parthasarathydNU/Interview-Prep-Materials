## Least Frequently Used (LFU)

### When to Use:
1. When access frequency is more important than recency
2. For workloads with stable popularity patterns
3. When you want to keep items with consistent, frequent access

### Advantages:
- Keeps frequently accessed items in cache longer
- Better performance for workloads with clear frequency patterns

### Disadvantages:
- Can be slow to adapt to changing access patterns
- May keep old, once-popular items too long
- More complex to implement efficiently

## Least Recently Used (LRU)

### When to Use:
1. When recency of access is more important than frequency
2. For workloads with temporal locality
3. When access patterns change frequently

### Advantages:
- Adapts quickly to changing access patterns
- Simpler to implement efficiently
- Works well for many general-purpose caching scenarios

### Disadvantages:
- May evict frequently used items if they haven't been accessed recently
- Can perform poorly with cyclic access patterns

## Choosing Between LFU and LRU

1. **Analyze Your Workload:**
   - LFU for stable, frequency-based access patterns
   - LRU for rapidly changing, recency-based access patterns

2. **Consider Data Characteristics:**
   - LFU for data with long-term popularity
   - LRU for data with short-term, bursty popularity

3. **Evaluate Implementation Complexity:**
   - LRU is generally simpler to implement
   - LFU can be more complex but may offer better performance for certain workloads

4. **Think About Adaptability:**
   - LRU adapts faster to changes
   - LFU maintains a longer-term view of popularity

5. **Performance Requirements:**
   - LFU might provide better hit rates for certain workloads
   - LRU often provides more consistent performance across varied workloads

6. **Memory Overhead:**
   - LRU typically requires less additional memory
   - LFU needs to store frequency counters, increasing memory usage

## Hybrid Approaches

Consider hybrid policies like LRU-K or LRFU (Least Recently and Frequently Used) for workloads that don't clearly favor either LFU or LRU.
