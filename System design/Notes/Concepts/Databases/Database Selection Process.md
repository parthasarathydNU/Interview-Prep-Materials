Databases do not generally impact your functional requirements, we can satisfy our functional requirements with any database but, it is the Non functional requirements that get impacted by the choice of our database. 

So it it key to move our attention to database choices and options discussion during the Non Functional portion of the System Design Interview. 

The choice of the database will impact how much our system can scale and we need to ensure that the right database is selected to ensure we meet our Non Functional requirements.

2. Query pattern that we have
3. Amount of scale that we need to handle
