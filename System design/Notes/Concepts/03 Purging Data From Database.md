Yes, it is possible to automatically purge entries from a SQL database based on expiry time. This is a common requirement in many systems, especially those dealing with temporary data, session management, or time-sensitive information. Let's explore how this can be implemented:

Here are several approaches to automatically purge entries based on expiry time:

1. **Database-level Mechanisms:**

   a) **Partitioning:** Some databases support time-based partitioning, where you can automatically drop old partitions.

   ```sql
   -- Example in PostgreSQL
   CREATE TABLE events (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       event_time TIMESTAMP,
       data TEXT
   ) PARTITION BY RANGE (event_time);

   -- Create partitions
   CREATE TABLE events_2023 PARTITION OF events
       FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2024-01-01');

   -- Automatically drop old partitions
   DROP TABLE events_2022;
   ```

   b) **Triggers:** Set up a trigger to delete expired rows when they're accessed.

   ```sql
   CREATE TRIGGER delete_expired_rows
   BEFORE SELECT ON your_table
   FOR EACH ROW
   EXECUTE FUNCTION check_and_delete_expired();

   CREATE FUNCTION check_and_delete_expired() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
   BEGIN
     DELETE FROM your_table WHERE expiry_time < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
     RETURN NEW;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```

2. **Application-level Mechanisms:**

   a) **Scheduled Jobs:** Use a job scheduler (like cron) to run a script periodically.

   ```python
   def purge_expired_entries():
       with connection.cursor() as cursor:
           cursor.execute("DELETE FROM your_table WHERE expiry_time < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP")
   
   # Run this function periodically
   ```

   b) **Lazy Deletion:** Check and delete expired entries when accessing data.

   ```python
   def get_entry(id):
       with connection.cursor() as cursor:
           cursor.execute("DELETE FROM your_table WHERE expiry_time < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP")
           cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE id = %s", (id,))
           return cursor.fetchone()
   ```

3. **Database Features:**
   Some databases have built-in features for this:

   - **MySQL:** Event Scheduler
   - **PostgreSQL:** pg_cron extension
   - **Oracle:** Automatic Data Optimization (ADO)

   ```sql
   -- Example using MySQL Event Scheduler
   CREATE EVENT purge_expired_entries
   ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
   DO
     DELETE FROM your_table WHERE expiry_time < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
   ```

Key considerations for an SDE II:

1. **Performance Impact:** Purging large amounts of data can impact database performance. Consider doing this during off-peak hours.

2. **Indexing:** Ensure the expiry_time column is indexed for efficient deletions.

3. **Batching:** For large tables, delete in batches to avoid long-running transactions.

4. **Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring to track the purge process.

5. **Consistency:** In distributed systems, ensure consistency across all nodes.

6. **Recovery:** Have a plan for recovering accidentally purged data (e.g., delayed hard delete or backup before purge).

7. **Compliance:** Ensure the purging mechanism complies with data retention policies and regulations.

In an interview, you could discuss these approaches, their trade-offs, and how you'd choose the best method based on the specific requirements of the system (e.g., data volume, access patterns, consistency needs).

Would you like to explore any of these methods in more detail, or discuss how you might implement this in a specific type of system?
