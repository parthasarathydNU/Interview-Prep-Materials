An API is just a different set of tools and protocols for building a software application and they define how different components of the software application interact over any given network.

Simple examples could be just getting data from a user interface and storing it in a database. But it can also get much more complex like create a new piece of compute.. the applications are endless.

### Types of APIs
- [[02 REST API]]
- [[03 SOAP API]]
- [[04 GraphQL API]]

REST AND GRAPH QL:
- Suited for web services that are dynamic and have complex needs
SOAP: 
- More ideal for enterprise applications where we have really stringent standards and very high security like Banking
RPC Calls: 
- Best suited for internal systems and application where we just need to trigger simple remote procedures from an external location
