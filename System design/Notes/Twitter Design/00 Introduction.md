### Phases of the interview 

#### Phase 1: Defining requirements `ris:FileList2`

The very first step is to understand the requirements of the design. 

This serves two purposes:
1. To get the interviewer and us on the same page for the rest of the interview
2. To define a list of requirements that will serve as the guide for our design through the rest of the interview - this will tell us what we will be building during the interview

Here are the [[01 Functional Requirement]] and [[02 Non Functional requirement]]. In this phase of the interview, the most important part is list down these requirements and agree upon which are the core features that we will be focussing on during the next 35 minutes of the interview.

#### PRO TIP:  `ris:LightbulbFlash`

> ***Do not spend more than 5 minutes on this section*** `ris:TimerFlash`

While the requirements are incredibly important, they are not the most interesting part to the interviewer.
