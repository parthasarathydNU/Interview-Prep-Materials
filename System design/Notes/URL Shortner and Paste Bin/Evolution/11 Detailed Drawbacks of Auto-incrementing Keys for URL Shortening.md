## 1. Security Vulnerabilities

### Predictability and Enumeration
- Auto-incrementing IDs make URLs easily guessable. An attacker could systematically enumerate URLs (e.g., example.com/1, example.com/2, etc.) to access potentially sensitive or private content.
- This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to user data or expose usage patterns of your service.

### Information Disclosure
- Sequential IDs can reveal information about your system:
  - Total number of URLs shortened
  - Rate of growth over time
  - Usage patterns (e.g., spikes in URL creation)
- Competitors or malicious actors could use this information for business intelligence or to target your service.

## 2. Scalability Challenges

### Distributed Systems Limitations
- In a distributed system, maintaining a global, strictly increasing ID across multiple nodes is challenging:
  - It can create a single point of failure
  - It may require complex coordination mechanisms, impacting performance
- Solutions like using a centralized ID server can become a bottleneck under high load

### Database Partitioning Difficulties
- Sharding or partitioning the database becomes complex with sequential IDs:
  - Even distribution of data across shards is harder
  - It may lead to hotspots where certain shards receive more traffic

## 3. Performance Concerns

### Database Dependency
- Relying on the database for ID generation can become a performance bottleneck:
  - Each insert operation requires a round trip to the database
  - Under high concurrency, this can lead to contention and reduced throughput

### Lock Contention
- Auto-incrementing fields often involve some form of locking mechanism in the database:
  - This can lead to increased lock contention under high write loads
  - It may impact the overall performance of the database, affecting other operations

## 4. Limited Namespace

### Exhaustion of IDs
- Depending on the data type used (e.g., INT, BIGINT), you may eventually run out of unique IDs:
  - 32-bit INT maxes out at ~2.14 billion
  - Even 64-bit BIGINT has a finite limit, which could be reached in high-volume systems

### Inefficient URL Length
- Purely numeric IDs are less space-efficient when converted to a string representation:
  - You'd need to use a base conversion (e.g., base62) to create shorter strings
  - This adds computational overhead and may still result in longer URLs compared to other methods

## 5. Lack of Customization

### No Vanity URLs
- Auto-incrementing IDs don't allow for custom or vanity URLs, which can be a desirable feature for users or for branding purposes.

### No Metadata Embedding
- Unlike some other methods, auto-incrementing IDs don't allow for embedding useful metadata (like creation timestamp) in the URL itself.

## 6. Potential for Bugs and Errors

### ID Reuse Risks
- If IDs are ever reset or reused (e.g., after reaching the maximum value), it could lead to collisions and incorrect URL resolution.

### Synchronization Errors
- In distributed systems, synchronization issues could lead to duplicate IDs being generated, causing conflicts and data integrity problems.
