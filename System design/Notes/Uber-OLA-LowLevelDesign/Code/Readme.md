# Uber-Like System Design

This project implements a simplified version of an Uber-like ride-sharing system, demonstrating various object-oriented design principles and design patterns.

If you are interested to contribute and build along check out the "Future Enhancements and Collaboration Opportunities" section below.

## Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
- Implemented in `EntityManagerSingletonClasses/SingletonBaseClass.py`
- Used for manager classes like `TripManager`, `DriverManager`, and `RiderManager`
- Ensures only one instance of these managers exists throughout the application

### Strategy Pattern
- Implemented in `Strategies/DriverSelectionStrategies`
- Allows for flexible driver selection algorithms
- Managed by `StrategyManager` which is also a singleton

## Object-Oriented Principles

### Encapsulation
- Demonstrated in entity classes like `Driver`, `Rider`, and `Trip`
- Private attributes with public getter/setter methods

### Inheritance
- `Driver` and `Rider` classes inherit from a base `Person` class
- Manager classes inherit from `SingletonBaseClass`

### Abstraction
- Abstract base classes and interfaces used (e.g., `SingletonBaseClass`)
- Hides complex implementation details from the user of the classes

### Polymorphism
- Different driver selection strategies can be used interchangeably

## Key Components

- `Entities/`: Contains core domain objects (Driver, Rider, Trip, etc.)
- `EntityManagerSingletonClasses/`: Singleton managers for entities
- `Strategies/`: Different algorithms for driver selection
- `Enums/`: Enumerations for ratings and other fixed categories

## Usage

The main application logic is in `Uber.py`. Run this file to start the system:

```bash
python Uber.py
```

## Future Enhancements and Collaboration Opportunities

We welcome contributors to help expand and improve this project. Here are some exciting areas where you can make a significant impact:

1. Geospatial Features
   - Implement OpenStreetMap integration for realistic city layouts
   - Develop path-finding algorithms (e.g., A*, Dijkstra's) for route optimization
   - Create visualizations of driver and rider distributions

2. Simulation and Testing Framework
   - Build a simulation engine to test the system at scale
   - Develop unit and integration test suites
   - Create scenario generators for diverse testing conditions

3. API Development and Documentation
   - Design and implement a RESTful API for the core functionalities
   - Create comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger
   - Develop example client applications (web, mobile) using the API

4. Performance Optimization
   - Implement caching strategies to improve response times
   - Optimize database queries and indexing
   - Explore asynchronous programming techniques for better concurrency

5. Machine Learning Integration
   - Develop predictive models for demand forecasting
   - Create a driver-rider matching algorithm using machine learning
   - Implement a dynamic pricing model based on historical data

6. User Interface
   - Design and implement a web-based dashboard for system monitoring
   - Create a simple mobile app interface for riders and drivers
   - Develop admin tools for managing users, trips, and system settings

7. Extended Pricing Models
   - Implement surge pricing based on demand and supply
   - Develop a flexible fare calculation system supporting various factors
   - Create a simulator for testing different pricing strategies

8. Localization and Internationalization
   - Add support for multiple languages
   - Implement region-specific features and regulations
   - Create a framework for easy addition of new locales

9. Advanced Matching Algorithms
   - Develop algorithms for carpooling and ride-sharing
   - Implement a queueing system for fair request distribution
   - Create specialized matching for different vehicle types or service levels

10. Documentation and Tutorials
    - Write comprehensive documentation for the codebase
    - Create tutorials for setting up and extending the system
    - Develop a contributing guide for new collaborators
