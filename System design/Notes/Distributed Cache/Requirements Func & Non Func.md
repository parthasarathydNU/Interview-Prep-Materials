Functional
- put (key, value) 
- get (key)

Non - Functional

- Scalable ( scales out easily together with increasing number of requests and data )
- Highly Available ( Survives network/ hardware failures and is also available across network partitions) - This also ensures lesser cache misses and therefore lesser calls to the database and more information served from the cache
- Highly performant ( fast puts and gets ) 

High performance in possibly the number one requirement for the distributed cache because it is called on every requests. 

### TIP:
Thinking about functional requirements is easy, but it is hard to think about non functional requirements. 

For systems like a distributed cache, think about scalability, availability and performance. 

If persistence is important, then think about Durability as well.

### TIP: 

Remember the interviewer is your friend. Our goal is to provide as many positive data points as possible, and the interviewerâ€™s goal is to collect as many positive data points as possible.

In Practice, we should start approaching any design problem with small and simple steps, and evolve it. This is a win-win situation. We show progress, ability to deal with ambiguity and simplify things. This will help the interviewer bring data points to the table and champion our case.
