Design a distributed caching system.

Problem statement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuqZvajTOyA

Say we have a simple system where a client talks to a web service that fetches data from a DataStore. 

Problems with current approach: 
1. Sometimes calls to datastore can have latency issues
2. DataStore can go down, it would be good to still continue serving requests to the clients even though it isnâ€™t up to date

Why do we need a Distributed Cache ? 
- The amount of data is too large to be stored in memory of a single machine
- And we will need to split the data and store it across several machines
