# Distributed Cache System Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of a scalable, highly available distributed cache system. The system evolves from a simple single-host cache to a robust, distributed architecture capable of handling large-scale applications.

## Key Features

- Scalable architecture
- High availability
- Consistent hashing for efficient data distribution
- Replica nodes for improved read performance and data availability
- Cross-datacenter replication
- Configuration management using ZooKeeper

## System Components

### 1. Cache Client

- Implements consistent hashing algorithm
- Uses binary search to quickly identify the correct cache host
- Communicates with ZooKeeper for up-to-date cache host information

### 2. Cache Hosts

- Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
- Support sharding for distributed data storage
- Register themselves with ZooKeeper and maintain heartbeat

### 3. Replica Nodes

- Follow master nodes to maintain data copies
- Handle most read requests to improve performance
- Spread across multiple data centers for improved availability

### 4. ZooKeeper (Configuration Service)

- Maintains registry of all cache hosts
- Provides consistent view of cache topology to all clients
- Monitors node health and manages failover

## Key Algorithms and Techniques

1. Consistent Hashing: For efficient data distribution and minimal redistribution on cluster changes
2. LRU (Least Recently Used): For efficient cache eviction
3. Binary Search: For quick shard location in the cache client

## Advanced Features

- TTL (Time To Live) for cache entries to manage stale data
- Encryption and decryption for enhanced security
- Monitoring and logging for system health and performance tracking
- Proxy layer between cache client and servers for simplified client implementation

## Challenges and Solutions

1. Hot Shards: Mitigated by replica nodes and load balancing
2. Data Availability: Addressed through cross-datacenter replication
3. Data Consistency: Acknowledged as a challenge in distributed systems, with cache misses as a potential outcome
4. Domino Effect in Consistent Hashing: Can be mitigated using jump hashing or consistent proportional hashing

## Performance Considerations

- Trade-offs between consistency and performance
- Potential performance impact of security measures (encryption/decryption)
- Optimized shard location algorithms in cache clients

## Future Improvements

- Implement jump hashing or consistent proportional hashing for better load distribution
- Enhance security measures with minimal performance impact
- Develop more sophisticated monitoring and auto-scaling capabilities
