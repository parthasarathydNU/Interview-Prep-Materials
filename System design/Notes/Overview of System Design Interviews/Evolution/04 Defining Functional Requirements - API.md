After figuring out what a system should do we write it down.


| The system has to `count` video `view events`<br><br>Here `count` is the action and `viewEvents` is the type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <br>Similarly for the consumption stand point: <br><br>The system has to return **video views** for a given time period<br><br>**`getViewsCount(videoId, startTime, endTime)`**                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| This can be converted to the following api:<br><br>`countViewEvent(videoId)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <br>The system has to count other types of events as well<br><br>**`getCount(videoId, eventType, startTime, endTime)`**                                                                        |
| <br>If we want the system to calculate not just views but a broader set of events<br><br>Let's say, `likes, shares and comments`, we can make a generalized api. <br><br>**The system has to `count` different types of `events`**<br><br>Here `count` is the action and `eventType` is a parameter along with the `videoId`<br><br>**`countEvent(videoId, eventType)`**                                                              | <br>The system has to provide other types of stats for a given event type, like count, average, sum, min, max , etc...<br><br>**`getStats(videoId, eventType, function, startTime, endTime)`** |
| <br>Now if we want to system to not just provide count values, but other types of calculations `sum, average` as well, we can further expand the API <br><br>**The system has to perform a `function` on different types of `events`**<br><br>Here `performCalculation` is the action, the `function` that does the calculation, `eventId` and `videoId are parameters`<br><br>**`performCalculation(videoId, eventType, function)`** |                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <br>We can further generalize the API, and say that the system will not process events one by one, but a list of events as a single Batch<br><br>**`processEvents(listOfEvents)`** <br><br>Where each event is an object that contains information about the a video, type of the event, time when event happened and so forth<br>                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Following the above technique, will help us identify names of the APIs, the input parameters and if needed make several iterations to generalize APIs. These APIs must help satisfy the functional requirements.
