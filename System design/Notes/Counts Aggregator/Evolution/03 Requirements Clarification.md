### Here is a little secret

During the requirements clarification section, the interviewer starts to understand our level of expertise with system design.

As with coding interviews, if we don't ask questions, it is a warning sign for interviews. Think along the following 4 categories, 
- think about data, 
- how much data, 
- what data, 
- how does it get in and get out of the system

Don't worry about time too much. We can rather spend an extra 5 minutes clarifying requirements and scope rather than solving for a different set of requirements than what the interviewer asked. 

> The end goal of requirements gathering is to get us closer to defining the functional and non functional requirements

Functional Requirements: 
- System behavior
- APIs (set of operations) that the system will support
- This is what the system will do

Non Functional Requirements:
- System qualities
- Fast,
- Fault tolerant
- Secure
- How a system is supposed to be
