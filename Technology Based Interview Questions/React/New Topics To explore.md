1. Core React Concepts:
   - JSX syntax and its relationship to JavaScript
   - Components (functional and class-based)
   - Props and state management
   - Lifecycle methods (for class components)
   - Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback)
   - Virtual DOM and React's rendering process
   - React.memo for performance optimization

2. State Management:
   - Local state vs. global state
   - Context API for state management
   - Redux (actions, reducers, store, connect, and hooks like useSelector and useDispatch)
   - State immutability and best practices

3. Routing:
   - React Router (setting up routes, nested routes, route parameters)
   - Programmatic navigation

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - useCallback and useMemo for memoization
   - React.PureComponent and shouldComponentUpdate
   - Profiling and debugging React applications

5. Forms and User Input:
   - Controlled vs. uncontrolled components
   - Form validation techniques
   - Custom hooks for form handling

6. API Integration:
   - Fetching data with useEffect
   - Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests
   - Handling loading states and errors
   - React Query for advanced data fetching and caching

7. Testing:
   - Jest for unit and integration testing
   - React Testing Library for component testing
   - Mocking API calls in tests

8. Advanced Patterns:
   - Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
   - Render props pattern
   - Compound components
   - Custom hooks

9. Styling in React:
   - CSS Modules
   - Styled-components or Emotion for CSS-in-JS
   - Tailwind CSS (mentioned in the artifact instructions)

10. Type Checking:
    - PropTypes
    - TypeScript with React

11. Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation:
    - Next.js basics (since it's mentioned in your resume)

12. React Ecosystem:
    - Understanding how to integrate with other libraries (e.g., chart libraries, form libraries)

13. Best Practices:
    - Component composition
    - Code organization and project structure
    - Error boundaries
    - Accessibility in React applications

14. Modern React Features:
    - Concurrent Mode and Suspense
    - Server Components (if using React 18+)

15. State Management Libraries:
    - Recoil, Jotai, or Zustand (as alternatives to Redux)

16. Build Tools and Development Environment:
    - Create React App
    - Webpack configuration basics
    - Environment variables in React
