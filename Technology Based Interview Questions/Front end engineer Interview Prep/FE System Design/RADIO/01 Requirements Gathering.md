max 15% of the session. No two system design interview experiences are the same even though you can be asked the same question. Interviewers have different backgrounds and might prioritize different aspects of the system. Take this chance to find out what they are most interested in an plan your answers accordingly.

#### Questions to ask: 

##### What are the main use cases we should be focussing on ? 

Here have a set of unique aspects about the product already in mind, however still go ahead and confirm the same with the interviewer.

For example, for facebook: it woul dbe the news feed, pagination of the feed and creating new posts. 

For YouTube, it would be the video watching experience.

Refer https://www.greatfrontend.com/system-design/types-of-questions to understand important areas for each type of system.

#### What are the functional and non functional requirements ? 

In interviews, we will not be expected to completely implement the system, but rather they want to see how we approach it and how we break down ambiguity and proceed.

Take initiative to list out what we think are the functional requirements ( these correspond to the API ) and get feedback and alignment from the interviewer. 

Post the functional requirements go on to list the non functional requirements and get alignment with the interviewer. 

#### What are the core features to focus on and what are the good to have ones ? 

Amongst the functional requirements, ask the interviewer which they are most interested in and which are good to have ones. This way during the interview we can complete designing for the core features and then move on to talk about the good to have ones.

Briefly probably for 30 seconds or so talk about 
- Who are the users
- What devices do we need to support
