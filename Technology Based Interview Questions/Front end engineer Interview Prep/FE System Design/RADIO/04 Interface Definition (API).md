Here we define the interface between the components in the product, functionality of various APIs, their params and responses.

Every API has Three Parts, 
- Name and functionality
- Parameters
- Return Value

For a Server API it contains the HTTP Path, the query and parameters and the response and format

Similarly for a Client API it includes a javascript function, function parameters and the function return value. The most important parts to describe a client - client API is the functionality of the API, the params and return value. 

If we are being asked to define a UI Component, for this section, talk about 
- customization options
- data props 
- function props
