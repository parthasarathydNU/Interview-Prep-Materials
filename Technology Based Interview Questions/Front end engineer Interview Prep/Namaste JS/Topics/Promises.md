A promise can have three states
- Pending
- Fulfilled 
- Rejected

The returned data from promises are immutable.

#### Definitions of a promise: 

- A promise is a placeholder for data that will be returned from an async operation
- A promise is a container for a future value after the promise is resolved
- A promise is an object that represents the `eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation` in javascript
