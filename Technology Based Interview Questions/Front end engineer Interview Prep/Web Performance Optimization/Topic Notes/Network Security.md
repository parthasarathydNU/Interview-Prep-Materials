#### Same site and same origin

Origin is a combination of scheme, hostname and port.

For example, given a URL of `https://www.example.com:443/foo` , the "origin" is `https://www.example.com:443`.

Websites that have the combination of the same scheme, hostname, and port are considered "same-origin". Everything else is considered "cross-origin".
