### What is ECMA ?

ECMA International - an organization that creates standards for technologies. 

**ECMA-262**
Standard published by ECMA international that contains specification for general purpose scripting languages. 

This **version "262" of the list of various standards** defined by ECMA, refers to a scripting language specification called as "ECMAScript" a.k.a **ECMAScript Specification.**

> ECMA-260, ECMA-261, ECMA-262. There’s ECMAScript.


#### What is a scripting language ? 

> A programming language designed specifically for acting on an existing entity or system. 

Consider the commands “walk”, “run”, and “jump.” These actions require something to carry them out, perhaps a person, a dog, or a video game character. Without an actor to perform these commands, “walk”, “run”, and “jump” wouldn’t make sense. This set of actions is analogous to a scripting language that focuses on manipulating an external entity.

### ECMA Script

ECMAScript provides the rules, details, and guidelines that a scripting language must observe to be considered ECMAScript compliant.

#### Conformance - Excerpt from the ECMAScript 2017 Specification

A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must provide and support 
- all types, values, objects, properties, functions and program syntax and semantics as described in this specification.
- Linguistic and cultural conventions used by different human languages
- May provide additional types, values, objects, properties and functions beyond those described in this specification
- May support program and regular expression syntax not described in this spec
- May NOT implement any extension that is listed as a Forbidden Extension

### JavaScript

A general purpose scripting language that confirms to the ECMAScript Specification. ECMAScript specification is the specification that JS is based on.

There are some non ECMAScript Features that Javascript has that are specified in the Mozilla Documentation. 

### A Javascript Engine: 
A program or interpreter that understands and executes Javascript code. 

V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox and Chakra in Edge. Each engine is a language module for the browser, allowing it to support a certain subset of the JavaScript language.

#### Differences in Browser Support

some browsers have a greater understanding of the language than others. There are differences in the way browsers support the language.

With regards to browser support, people usually talk about “ECMAScript compatibility”

When ECMAScript releases a new edition it does not mean all JS Engines suddenly have those features, it is upto groups or organizations who are responsible for JS Engines to be up-to date about the latest ECMAScript Specification and to adopt these changes.

Also when a JS engine incorporate new ECMAScript Features, they do it incrementally over time.

In Firefox 50, pieces of ES2015 and ES2017 were both implemented in Firefox’s JavaScript engine, SpiderMonkey. Other pieces of ES2015 and ES2017 were implemented before, and will continue to be implemented in the future.

### Javascript Run Time

The environment in which code runs and is interpreted by the Engine. The runtime provides the host objects that JS can operate on and work with. 

Applications make themselves available to JS Scripting by providing "host objects" at run time. 

>For the client side , the JS run time would be the browser, where objects like windows, and HTML documents are made available for manipulation. 

Also different JS runtimes can share the same JS engine. Example both Google Chrome and Node.JS use the V8 engine.

### ECMAScript 6
This is the 6th edition of the ECMA-262 standard and features major changes and improvements to the ECMAScript specification. 

EC6 and ES2015 are synonyms. 

### Babel
This is a transpiler that can convert ES6 code to ES5 code.  Developers can use the shiny new features that come with ES6 but may be concerned with cross compatibility with browsers that do not fully support ES6 features. 

In such cases, Babel can be used to convert ES6 code to a functionally equivalent version that only uses ES5 features.
