We've all heard how important performance is. But when we talk about performance—and about making websites "fast"—what specifically do we mean?

## Types of metrics

There are several types of metrics of how users perceive performance:

- **Perceived Load Speed** - How quickly a page can load and render all of it's visual elements on the screen
- **Component Load Responsiveness** - How quickly can the page load the java script code and have the components ready for user interaction
- **Runtime Responsiveness** - How quick do the UI components respond to user interaction after loading and during run time
- **Visual Stability** - Do elements on the page shift in ways that the user might not expect thereby giving them a confusing user experience
- **Smoothness** - Do transitions render at a consistent frame rate and flow smoothly from one state to another 

### Important metrics to measure

- **First Contentful Paint** - time between when the page starts loading to when the first UI element is visible on the browser
- **Largest Contentful Paint**  - same as above, but for the largest element to be visible on the browser
- **[[Interaction to next paint]]** - the latency of every click , tap or keyboard interaction made with the page
- **Time to first byte** - The time taken for the network to respond to any request with the first byte of a resource
- **Total blocking time** - The cumulative time when the main thread remains blocked
